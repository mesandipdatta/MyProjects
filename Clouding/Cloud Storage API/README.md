Up and Running with Cloud Storage APIs

Cloud storage services give you limitless capacity and flexible access through convenient APIs. This course explores the RESTful APIs of several popular cloud storage services, and shows some practical examples of simple applications that can be built with them. Joseph LeBlanc shows how to access and retrieve data from Amazon S3 buckets; find, retrieve, and load files on Dropbox; authenticate with different services; and use APIs within larger applications. He also examines the pros and cons of alternatives like Azure, Rackspace, and Google Cloud Storage.
